["The Road Not Taken\n\nTwo roads diverged in a yellow wood,\n
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
To where it bent in the undergrowth;\n\nThen took the other, as just as fair,\nAnd having perhaps the better claim,\nBecause it was grassy and wanted wear;\nThough as for that the passing there\nHad worn them really about the same,\n\nAnd both that morning equally lay\nIn leaves no step had trodded black.\nOh. I kept the first for another day!\nYet knowing how way leads on to way,\nI doubted if I should ever come back.\n\nI shall be telling this with a sigh\nSomewhere ages and ages hence:\nTwo woods diverged in a wood, and Iâ€“\nI took the one less traveled by,\nAnd that has made all the difference.", "Underface\n\nUnderneath my outside face\nThere's a face that none can see.\nA little less smiley,\nA little less sure,\nBut a whole lot more like me.", "Nothing gold can stay\n\nNature's first green is gold,\nHer hardest hue to hold.\nHer early leaf's a flower;\nBut only so an hour.\nThen leaf subsides to leaf.\nSo Eden sank to grief,\nSo dawn goes down to day.\nNothing gold can stay.", "A Silly Poem\n\nSaid Hamlet to Ophelia,\nI'll draw a sketch of thee,\nWhat kind of pencil shall I use?\n2B or not 2B?", "Now you see me\n\nNow you see me, now you don't\nGoerge thinks he will, but I know he won't", "if I were king\n\nI often wish I were a King,\nAnd then I could do anything.\n\nIf only I were King of Spain,\nI'd take my hat off in the rain.\n\nIf only I were king of France.\nI wouldn't brush my hair for aunts.\n\nI think, if I were King of Greece,\nI'd push things off the mantelpiece.\n\nIf I were King of Norroway,\nI'd ask an elephant to stay.\n\nIf I were King of Babylon,\nI'd leave my button gloves undone.\n\nIf I were King of Timbuctoo,\nI'd think of lovely things to do.\n\nIf I were King of anything,\nI'd tell the soldiers, 'I'm the King!'"]
